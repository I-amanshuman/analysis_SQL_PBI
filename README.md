# analysis_SQL_PBI
In this project, I have downloaded raw backup data from microsoft servers, then used SQL to clean the data and extract necessary tables, which was then used in Power BI 
to get insights about the current Sales scenario, Customer Info, and Product Info

The business requirements that were answered via this analysis are:
1.	We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move forward from static to visual dashboards
2.	We want to focus on how much we sold of what products to which clients and how it has been over time
3.	Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also
4.	We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance
5.	The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales

Business Demand Overview:-
1.	Reporter: Sales head
2.	Value of change: Visual dashboard
3.	Necessary Systems: Power BI, CRM System
4.	Other relevant info: Budget has been delivered in excel 2021
